Create rules that trigger your Lambda functions

1.Open the Amazon Eventbridge page

2.Click Create rule

3.Add a name for the rule such as StartEC2Workday

4. Do either of the following:
For schedule , enter an interval of time in minutes, hours, or days.
For Cron expression, enter an expression that tells Lambda when to stop your instances. For information on the syntax of expressions, see Schedule Expressions for Rules.
Note: Cron expressions are evaluated in UTC. Be sure to adjust the expression for your preferred time zone.
For my example I used 22 01 * * ? * where this calls the target function every day of the year at 01:20 UTC.

5.    Under Targets, default target is added. 

6.    Choose Lambda function and select the name of the function to use.

7.   click Save
